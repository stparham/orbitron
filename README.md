This was an honors project I made for my intro programming course at NCSU in the 2016 Spring semester.  Since the course didn't even begin to talk about object-oriented programming until the last few weeks of the semester, I spent a lot of time learning and understanding OOP concepts and applying them in my game.  Overall, I had a ton of fun working on the project and learning from it.

I show a few pictures of the "completed" game on my website [here](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~stparham/projects.html).
